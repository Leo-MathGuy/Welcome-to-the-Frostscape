family.hollow-frostscape-hunter.name = Hunter
family.hollow-frostscape-hunter.description = A family of units designed to hunt down targets, and harass larger threats.
family.hollow-frostscape-hunter.details = [#dde6f0]Hunters[] are often built with at least one of three traits in mind.\n\nSpeed, range or stealth.\n\nThis makes them [accent]ideal[] for "hunting" or harassing targets.\n\nSpecialized hunters can serve a secondary use, although less pronounced. Speedier hunters can be used to scout ahead, or to patrol territory. Particularly stealthy hunters can be used as ambush units, although not built for facing full armies or assaulting buildings behind the front lines. Overall though they are quite [accent]versatile[].\n\nDespite their abilities, they are generally [red]worse[] at dealing with [accent]organized defenses[] than [accent]small outposts or assault squads[].\n\nA common hunter unit is the [#dde6f0]Sunspot[], a charging flying unit with a melee weapon on it's front. It's lightweight body and powerful engine make it very mobile, while still being able to ram its targets with enough force to damage them.\n\nThe Sunspot is [red]weak[] against [accent]organized defenses[], with [accent]area damage[] or [accent]knockback capabilities[], and won't put up much of a fight against larger targets.\n\nMost hunters are best used alone, and do not lend much support to army compositions, however certain hunters may provide boosts to allied units in an area around themselves, making them a slight bit more useful when in a group.

They are overall your go-to choice when unsure about which tactic will work best against an unknown, fortified outpost.
