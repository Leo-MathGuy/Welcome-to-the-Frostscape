## Overveiw
Environmental scanning is a mechanic in Frostscape which allows the player to scan environment blocks. It allows you to unlock blocks to read their descriptions and details. Why would you do that?... for fun I suppose. Environmental scanning was added as a novel mechanic, and won't be used in any key progression.

## How do I use it?
Start by launching the game, and getting intoa  campaign map (Note that while scanning can be used in custom games, it doesn't actually unlock blocks. Sorry!)

For PC players, press ; to toggle the scanner. It should look something like this.
