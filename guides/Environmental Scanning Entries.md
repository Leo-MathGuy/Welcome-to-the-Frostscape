## Overveiw
Environmental scanning is a mechanic in Frostscape which allows the player to scan environment blocks. It allows you to unlock blocks to read their descriptions and details. Why would you do that?... for fun I suppose. Environmental scanning was added as a novel mechanic, and won't be used in any key progression.

# How do I use it?
Unfortunately this feature only supports PC players for the time being (Sorry moble players :c)

## Pc players
Start by launching the game, and getting intoa  campaign map (Note that while scanning can be used in custom games, it doesn't actually unlock blocks. Sorry!)

For PC players, press ; to toggle the scanner. It should look something like this.

When moving around your cursor, you may notice the rectical follow it. The gray square indicates the tile you're going to scan. If you try hovering over a building, it'll show this

Buildings can't be scanned, so a red X will appear next to them. In order to scan a tile, you need to scan an enironmental block/overlay/floor.

When holding down the left mouse button, you will start scanning. Upon that, the rectical will start to spin faster and faster, shrinking to show progress. Halfway through the process, a radial progress meter will appear.

Upon finishing scanning, you will "unlock" the block, and it will appear in the extra database.
